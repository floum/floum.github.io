Many sites on the web explain how to do this from the Windows GUI but,
as I came across a IIS version on which it was not possible,
here is the command line for IIS 7.5 on Windows Server 2008 R2
{% highlight bat %}
REM replace SITE.NAME and SITE.DOMAIN_NAME in the code below
appcmd set site /site.name:"SITE.NAME" /+bindings.[protocol='https', bindingInformation='*:443:SITE.DOMAIN_NAME']
{% endhighlight %}
