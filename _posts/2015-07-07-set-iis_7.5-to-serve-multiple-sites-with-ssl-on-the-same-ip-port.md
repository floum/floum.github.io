title: 'IIS 7.5 SSL IP:port configuration'
---
## Context

* Windows Server 2008 R2

* IIS 7.5

* a wildcard certificate

## Problem

* you want to serve multiple subdomain sites on the same IP:port over SSL

## Solution

Many sites on the web explain how to do this from the Windows GUI but,
as I came across a IIS version on which it was not possible,
here is the command line for IIS 7.5 on Windows Server 2008 R2

{% highlight bat %}
REM replace SITE.NAME and SITE.DOMAIN_NAME in the code below
appcmd set site /site.name:"SITE.NAME" /+bindings.[protocol='https', bindingInformation='*:443:SITE.DOMAIN_NAME']
{% endhighlight %}
